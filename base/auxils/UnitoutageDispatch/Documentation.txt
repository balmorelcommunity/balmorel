This tool allows to calculate stochastic outage of available installed units based on Monte Carlo simulations. It is assumed that outages only last for 1 time step. 

The tool uses as key input:
- Installed capacity per area (GKFX or GKACCUMNET)
- Planned maintenance (UCONMAINT) (optional)
- Unit size (from GDATA)
- Average annual forced outage rate of available units (from GDATA)
- Default availability (GKRATE) (For consistency and memory efficiency reasons, it is advised that GKRATE has values of 0 (which in Balmorel means 1))

The output is the IGKRATE.gdx file. This file is meant to be used as input in Balmorel when activating the option IGKRATE_STOCHASTIC

Special considerations:

If the ratio between available units and unit size is larger than parameter RATIO_LIM, then the average  annual forced outage rate is assumed
If the ration between available units and unit size is smaller than 1, then the unit is defined to be always available.
